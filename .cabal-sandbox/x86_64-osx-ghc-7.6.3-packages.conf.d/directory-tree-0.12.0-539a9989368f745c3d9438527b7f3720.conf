synopsis: A simple directory-like tree datatype, with useful IO functions
description: A simple directory-like tree datatype, with useful IO functions and Foldable and Traversable instance
             .
             Provides a simple data structure mirroring a directory tree on the
             filesystem, as well as useful functions for reading and writing
             file and directory structures in the IO monad.
             .
             Importing the library and optional (useful) Foldable and Traverable libraries:
             .
             > import System.Directory.Tree
             > import qualified Data.Foldable as F
             > import qualified Data.Traversable as T
             .
             Write a hand-made directory tree of textfiles (strings) to the disk.
             Simulates creating a new user Tux's home directory on a unix machine:
             .
             > writeDirectory$ "/home" :/ Dir "Tux" [File "README" "Welcome!"]
             .
             "read" a directory by opening all the files at a filepath with readFile,
             returning an 'AnchoredDirTree String' (d2). Then check for any IO failures:
             .
             > do (base :/ d2) <- readDirectory "../parent_dir/dir2/"
             >    let failed = anyFailed d2
             >    if failed then ...
             .
             Use Foldable instance function to concat a directory 'dir' of text files into a
             single file under the same directory:
             .
             > do (b :/ dt) <- readDirectory dir
             >    let f = F.concat dt
             >    return$ b :/ File "ALL_TEXT" f
             .
             Open all the files in the current directory as lazy bytestrings, ignoring
             the base path in Anchored wrapper:
             .
             > import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as B
             > do (_ :/ dTree) <- readDirectoryWith B.readFile "./"
             .
             This version also offers an experimental function `readDirectoryWithL` that does
             lazy directory IO, allowing you to treat the returned `DirTree` as if it were a
             normal lazily-generated data structure.
             .
             For example, the following does only the amount of IO necessary to list the file
             names of the children of the root directory, similar to "ls /":
             .
             > do d <- readDirectoryWithL readFile "/"
             >    mapM_ (putStrLn . name) $ contents $ free d
             .
             Any ideas or suggestions for improvements are most welcome :-)
             .
             /CHANGES/: from 0.11
             .
             - export 'System.Directory.Tree.transformDir' as requested
             .
             - add test suite to cabal file
             .
             - remove redundant @removeNonexistent@ (thanks to dmwit for patch)
             .
